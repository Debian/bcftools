Description: Utilities for calling variants and manipulating VCFs and BCFs
 Bcftools is a set of utilities that manipulate variant calls in the Variant
 Call Format (VCF) and its binary counterpart BCF. All commands work
 transparently with both VCFs and BCFs, both uncompressed and BGZF-compressed.
 .
 Bcftools is designed to work on a stream. It regards an input file "-"
 as the standard input (stdin) and an output file "-" as the standard
 output (stdout). Several commands can thus be combined with Unix
 pipes.
